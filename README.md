# Political Influence On Covid Vaccination Disctibution

This report analyzes disparities in COVID-19 vaccine rollouts across countries, highlighting a significant correlation between early vaccine administration dates and higher national GDP, indicating political and economic inequities in global vaccine distribution.


## Key Findings

- **Disproportionate Early Access:** In December 2020, wealthier nations or countries with stronger political ties received COVID-19 vaccines first, leading to an early advantage in vaccine rollout.
- **Supply Shortages:** January 2021 experienced a significant reduction in global vaccine availability, primarily impacting lower-GDP nations, due to prior hoarding by economically powerful countries.
- **Correlation with GDP:** Statistical analysis confirmed a strong correlation between a countryâ€™s GDP and its timing of vaccine administration, highlighting economic status as a significant factor in vaccine distribution inequity.
